# üß™ Project status üß™
This project is currently in **_Beta_**

This was forked from [danger/kotlin](https://github.com/danger/kotlin) to undergo extensive project maintenance and opinionated changes that felt should
stand in its own repository.  I don't plan on changing the namespacing of classes, except for artifact targets, to maintain
as much compatibility between the two. However, there may be a point at which I deviate from this as the project continues to
grow.

# IntelliJ Plugin
This repository boasts an [IntelliJ Plugin](intellij-plugin/) that you can install to automatically load the
custom Danger kotlin script definition into the IDE for syntax highlighting and autocomplete.

Install the latest version via https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/26699-danger-kotlin

or

Directly in your IDE via

```
Plugins --> Marketplace --> Danger Kotlin
```


> [!NOTE]
> Custom Kotlin script definitions are still a bit wonky in the IDE so sometimes it can take a restart, or another file resolving for it to "settle down"

### Run Configurations
The plugin will also automatically detect `danger(args) {‚Ä¶}` in your Dangerfiles and provide a ‚ñ∂Ô∏é icon in the gutter for
testing your scripts directly in the IDE

### GitHub Plugin Integration
The plugin is also integrates with the built-in [GitHub Plugin][] to automatically detect open PRs for your current branch.
This allows you to run a `danger-kotlin pr` command directly from the IDE without having to copy the PR url. It will also
automatically hydrate the runtime environment with the auth token and host/api url information based on the remote you have configured
in `git`.

Additionally, it will use git to determine if you are on a branch that is not a base branch (i.e. `master`, `main`, `develop`) and
give you an option to run `danger local` against your base.
